# Do not use this app IT DOES NOT WORK
## Instead use the flutter version [https://github.com/TheStaticTurtle/DemoArenaMobile-Flutter](https://github.com/TheStaticTurtle/DemoArenaMobile-Flutter)
Reason for moving is to enable compatibility with IOS. It's also whyt this repo is archived

### There are better ways to do it
I know I didn't wrote the best code or use the best method 
(For instance accessing the iut should use a dynamic proxy not doing remote command execution)
